For my first foray into React, I will create a small application that identifies a key word in a sentance and list alternative word choices underneath. 

The user can select an alternative word choice and update the sentance to use the newly selected word. The original word in the sentance now becomes an alternative word choice.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
